Description: A real-time music analysis tool
 Tartini is a program designed as a practical music analysis tool for 
 singers and instrumentalists. Just plug in a microphone and instantly 
 your computer will give real-time feedback including:
 
 * Accurate pitch contours for visualising intonation, vibrato shape, 
 tuning or just which note is being played
 
 * Loudness graphs, to help analyse dynamics
 
 * Harmonic structure of a note describing timbre
